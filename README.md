1. Read about Java Servlets and Servlet Container, WAR (Web Application Archive)

2. Read about Apache tomcat and its working.

3.Create a sample WAR which exposes one service (/getEmpDetails) for accepting employee code as the GET parameter and return back employee                details in JSON format. Employee details can be extracted from a pre-filled Hashtable.
 
4, Use the above library in the Service for getting the employee details. (In the service the workflow would be  read the emp_code => call the relevant               function by passing emp_code and get the emp-details => frame the response => send the response.)

5.Use DHClient(Postman) for testing
